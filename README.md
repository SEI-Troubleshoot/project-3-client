## Planning Story
After our planning period we split up the setup of the front end client and back end api into pairs.  When the templates were ready, we set up the models and READMEs, then tested each CRUD with curl scripts. From here, our group met to split up tasks to work either individually or for pair programming to complete mvp requirements.
